- In nano, edit ~/.config/labwc/autostart and comment out the line
#/usr/bin/lwrespawn /usr/bin/wf-panel-pi &
(This disables the unneeded desktop panel that consumes resources.)
- Ot sudo pkill wf-panel-pi to kill itt temporary 

### 🔨 Installation

The fastest way to install Ragnar is using the automatic installation script :

```bash
# Download and run the installer
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreGode/Ragnar/main/install_ragnar.sh
sudo chmod +x install_ragnar.sh && sudo ./install_ragnar.sh
# On Raspberry Pi you'll be asked if an e-Paper HAT is attached; on other hardware it auto-selects server (headless) mode.
# It may take a while as many packages and modules will be installed. Reboot when it finishes.
```

**Installer intelligence (new):**
- Auto-detects distro/package manager (apt, dnf, pacman, zypper) and CPU arch to install the right package names.
- **Debian System Support**: Full compatibility with Debian-based distributions on ARM, ARM64, and AMD64 architectures.
- Profiles: **Pi + e-Paper** (display enabled) or **Server/Headless** (no display, modern web UI only). Non-Pi hardware defaults to Server/Headless.
- **Automatic Advanced Tools**: Systems with 8GB+ RAM automatically install advanced features during fresh setup—no prompts, fully automatic.
- **Smart Resource Management**: Pi Zero W/W2 automatically skip advanced tools due to hardware limitations.
- Server installs supported on AMD64/ARM64/ARMv7 with LAN-first networking; USB-gadget steps are skipped automatically off-Pi.
- On Pi, the only prompt is whether an e-Paper HAT is connected; everything else runs end-to-end automatically.
- Uses PiWheels on ARM, retries mirrors, and skips Pi-only steps on other hardware.

### 🐝 Ragnar + Pwnagotchi Side by Side

Want to keep Ragnar online while occasionally hopping into Pwnagotchi mode? A bundled helper script plus new dashboard controls make the swap painless:

1. SSH into Ragnar and run the installer as root:
  ```bash
  cd /home/ragnar/Ragnar
  sudo ./scripts/install_pwnagotchi.sh
  ```
  - The script installs Python dependencies, clones the upstream repo into `/opt/pwnagotchi`, writes `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml`, and drops a disabled `pwnagotchi.service`.
  - Progress is streamed to `/var/log/ragnar/pwnagotchi_install_<timestamp>.log` and mirrored in `data/pwnagotchi_status.json` for the UI.
2. Open the Ragnar web UI → **Config** tab → **Pwnagotchi Bridge**.
  - Use **Install or Repair** to re-run the script, **Switch to Pwnagotchi** to hand off the systemd services, and **Return to Ragnar** after rebooting.
  - Status, phase, and service health also show up on the Discovered tab card once the installer has finished, so you can monitor swaps while reviewing loot.

When you schedule a switch to Pwnagotchi, the dashboard warns that Ragnar's web API will go offline until you reboot or trigger the return flow. Plan for SSH access before swapping.
